# kegerator mod  

This project is a workaround to prevent short cycling on the Komos V2 kegerator. 

For some unknown reason the temperature controller occassionally turns the 
compressor on for about 1 second then immediately shuts it off. On my kegerator,
this can happen several times per hour. It tends to happen more often when the 
temperature setpoint is above 45 Â°F.

The workaround is to insert a small microcontroller board between the controlller
board and the compressor. This board intercepts the signal that controls the 
compressor. The software filters out any short transients and enforces a minimum 
on-time and a minimum off-time for the compressor.  

It has been running fine on my kegerator for several years now.

The board is installed inline between the front panel temperature controller and the 
compressor power board.

See the other folders for more information on the [hardware](hardware/README.md) 
and [software](software/README.md).

If you need hardware, contact me.  I may still have a few boards in stock.
